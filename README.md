# Smashing Magazine Page Project

In this project we learned some important concept about UX as an important part of a web page success. We use a scale of grey to spot the different parts of the page with an important visual weight. The darker the grey is the more important the visual weight is.

## Concepts applied here

* Visual weight
* Flex box
* Typography
